# Literacy-Study-Buddy
A prototype of an interactive ai assistant for elementary school students(3rd to 5th grade). Students would be able to enjoy a tool that combines some fun elements(choosing a character and a short cookie clicker) with ai assisted learning(for asking questions related to reading and writing, looking up definitions for note-taking, and more).
